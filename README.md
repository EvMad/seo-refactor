# seo-refactor

## Description

-This is my refactor of the Horiseon home page HTML. I took advantage of this opportunity to utilize semantic html, and to update the page's alt accesibility. 

-I encountered multiple issues with the appearance of the site upon changing the div elements to semantic names, but I was able to see how the CSS classes could
be consolidated into a more logical structure.

-I opted to submit my non-functioning draft, to highlight the semantic changes and streamlined style page I was able to create.

## Usage

-After I am able to fix my code, the site will feature enhanced accesibility.
